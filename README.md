Welcome to our E-Health project demonstration! ðŸ«€
This project regards an embedded device designed to monitor heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV), along with other useful blood pressure parameters, using the powerful STM32 microcontroller. 
We have used advanced sensors like ECG (Electrocardiogram) AD8232 Heart Module and PPG (Photoplethysmogram) PulseSensor to provide accurate and real-time health metrics. 
Everything is displayed on a SSD1306 OLED display, whose library can be found at https://github.com/afiskon/stm32-ssd1306.
